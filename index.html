    <h1>SPECIAL BULLETIN — JULY 22, 2025</h1><h2>MILESTONE TRAGEDY: 21/07 – A Date We’ll Never Forget</h2>

<p><span class="bold">Uttara, Diabari —</span> What began as a regular school day at Milestone School & College turned into a nightmare. At approximately midday on July 21, an FT-7 fighter jet crashed into the educational building, erupting into flames that devoured classrooms, shattered lives, and left behind charred futures.</p>

<p>The pilot, <span class="bold">Towkir</span>, reportedly lost control mid-air. What followed was not just a mechanical failure — it was a collapse of humanity, of responsibility, of justice.</p>

<h3>Burned by Fire, Betrayed by System</h3>
<p>As students screamed and bodies were carried out, help was neither fast nor free. Local rickshaw-pullers, CNG drivers — once the lifeline of our streets — raised fares from 20 to 200… 50 to 1000. Two-liter water bottles were sold at 600 taka near the site. People ran with children, not for help, but for profit.</p>

<p>Rescue operations were delayed. Bodies were recovered late at night — not at the “officially declared” 8PM deadline, but at 3AM. Survivors say soldiers were blocked, firemen stood alone, and false news spread faster than fire itself.</p>

<h3>Cover-Ups and Cold Hearts</h3>
<p>Authorities initially claimed “all students rescued.” But the next morning, more bodies were pulled out. Even now, the numbers don’t add up. The official death toll? <span class="bold">22</span>. The unofficial number whispered in hospital morgues? <span class="bold">200+</span>.</p>

<p>Why were we lied to? Why were bodies hidden from cameras? Why were we made to believe it was “under control”? And most of all — why is there no apology?</p>

<h3>What We Saw</h3>
<p>We saw children burn. We saw mothers faint. We saw uniformed men struggle in silence — and some, stay silent by choice. We saw opportunists make profit off pain. We saw a tragedy become a stage for shame.</p>

<h3>In Memoriam</h3>
<p class="quote">“A nation that loses its children, loses its future.”</p>
<p>We mourn. We remember. We demand answers. Let this not be a headline today and forgotten tomorrow. We call upon the Bangladesh Air Force, the Army, and civil authorities to answer — not just to us, but to the souls they could not save.</p>
