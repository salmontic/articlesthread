# The World Debt: $300 Trillion and the Reality for the Poor

Just found out an amazing thing: the world debt is 300 trillion dollars right now? Yes! But poor people like us think of whom? I got an answer to it: that is, to the billionaire, they don't even give tax for loans to banks.

Let me explain things to you guys. These billionaires actually take loans from banks, and they just provide interest to the bank, not the exact money of the loan. Then you will say, What about the down payment? If they provide a down payment, they have to give tax, yes? Yes, but down payments are only for poor people.

They're billionaires, so they don't need such things, you will think. If loan amounts become 0, then they will take another by owning another collectual company, and the bank will provide them the loans. If that's not possible, they will create a small shell company.

That's how billionaires don't pay taxes and poor people become poorer day by day.
